# Waste-Classification-CNN
Waste Classifier CNN model to sort waste into 9 categories (cardboard, glass, metal etc). Uses Keras &amp; OpenCV. Helps automate recycling. Dataset: RealWaste (150x150px images).     
 
-Dataset: Uses the RealWaste dataset with 9 categories (Cardboard, Food Organics, Glass, Metal, Miscellaneous Trash, Paper, Plastic, Textile Trash, Vegetation).  
-Preprocessing: Images resized to 150x150 pixels, normalized, and split into training/testing sets.  
CNN Model: Built with Keras, featuring:  
  - Convolutional & Max Pooling Layers  
  - Flatten & Dense Layers  
  - Softmax for multi-class classification  
  -Training: Optimized with Adam and evaluated using sparse categorical cross-entropy.  

Applications:  
- Smart waste sorting systems  
- Recycling automation  
- Environmental sustainability initiatives
Technologies Used:
- Python, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
